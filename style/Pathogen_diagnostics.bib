  abstract = {Reliable detection and identification of plant pathogens are essential for disease control strategies. Diagnostic methods commonly used to detect plant pathogens have limitations such as requirement of prior knowledge of the genome sequence, low sensitivity and a restricted ability to detect several pathogens simultaneously. The development of advanced DNA sequencing technologies has enabled determination of total nucleic acid content in biological samples. The possibility of using the single-molecule sequencing platform of Oxford Nanopore as a general method for diagnosis of plant diseases was examined. It was tested by sequencing DNA or RNA isolated from tissues with symptoms from plants of several families inoculated with known pathogens (e.g. bacteria, viruses, fungi, phytoplasma). Additionally, samples of groups of 200 seeds containing one infected seed of each of two or three pathogens, as well as samples with symptoms but unidentified pathogens were tested. Sequencing results were analysed with Nanopore data analysis tools. In all the inoculated plants, pathogens were identified in real time within 1–2 h of running the Nanopore sequencer and were classified to the species or genus level. DNA sequencing or direct RNA sequencing of samples with unidentified disease agents were validated by conventional diagnostic procedures (e.g. PCR, ELISA, Koch test), which supported the results obtained by Nanopore sequencing. The advantages of this technology include: long read lengths, fast run times, portability, low cost and the possibility of use in every laboratory. This study indicates that adoption of the Nanopore platform will be greatly advantageous for routine laboratory diagnosis.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Nanopore sequencing offers a portable and affordable alternative to sequencing-by-synthesis methods but suffers from lower accuracy and cannot sequence ultra-short DNA. This puts applications such as molecular diagnostics based on the analysis of cell-free DNA or single-nucleotide variants (SNV) out of reach. To overcome these limitations, we report a nanopore-based sequencing strategy in which short target sequences are first circularized and then amplified via rolling-circle amplification to produce long stretches of concatemeric repeats. These can be sequenced on the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), and the resulting repeat sequences aligned to produce a highly-accurate consensus that reduces the high error-rate present in the individual repeats. Using this approach, we demonstrate for the first time the ability to obtain unbiased and accurate nanopore data for target DNA sequences of \&lt; 100 bp. Critically, this approach is sensitive enough to achieve SNV discrimination in mixtures of sequences and even enables quantitative detection of specific variants present at ratios of \&lt; 10\%. Our method is simple, cost-effective, and only requires well-established processes. It therefore expands the utility of nanopore sequencing for molecular diagnostics and other applications, especially in resource-limited settings.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Isolates of Ascochyta rabiei from diseased chickpea (Cicer arietinum) from India, Iran, Turkey, and West Pakistan varied greatly in growth rate, sporulation, and colony appearance. Maximum spore production on various nutrient media occurred with 8\% chickpea seed meal agar (CSMA), whereas mycelial growth was usually greatest on CSMA or oatmeal agar. The optimum temperature for growth and sporulation was 15-20 C and the upper limit for growth was 30 C. Exposure of uniform colonies to continuous light on potato-dextrose agar increased mycelial growth rates and conidial production, whereas zonation occurred in most isolates exposed to alternating light and dark periods. Wavelengths of light in the near-ultraviolet and blue regions of the electromagnetic spectrum were responsible for increased growth and sporulation. In inoculation studies, A. rabiei infected chickpea, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Vigna sinensis, but was highly pathogenic only to chickpea. Of numerous chickpea lines tested, only one black-seeded type was highly resistant to most isolates of the pathogen. Pycnidia containing viable spores formed on dried chickpea stem pieces at temperatures of 10-30 C, but developed most quickly at 20 C. Mature pycnidia formed at 20 C in 46 hr in continuous light, 50 hr in alternating light and dark, and 68 hr in continuous dark. The fungus survived over 2 yr in naturally-infected chickpea tissue at temperatures of 10-35 C, relative humidities of 0-30\% and on the soil surface. Ascochyta lost its viability rapidly at 65-100\% relative humidity and at soil depths of 10-40 cm.},

  abstract = {The Australian Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labr. (syn. Phoma rabiei) population has low genotypic diversity with only one mating type detected to date, potentially precluding substantial evolution through recombination. However, a large diversity in aggressiveness exists. In an effort to better understand the risk from selective adaptation to currently used resistance sources and chemical control strategies, the population was examined in detail. For this, a total of 598 isolates were quasi-hierarchically sampled between 2013 and 2015 across all major Australian chickpea growing regions and commonly grown host genotypes. Although a large number of haplotypes were identified (66) through short sequence repeat (SSR) genotyping, overall low gene diversity (Hexp = 0.066) and genotypic diversity (D = 0.57) was detected. Almost 70\% of the isolates assessed were of a single dominant haplotype (ARH01). Disease screening on a differential host set, including three commonly deployed resistance sources, revealed distinct aggressiveness among the isolates, with 17\% of all isolates identified as highly aggressive. Almost 75\% of these were of the ARH01 haplotype. A similar pattern was observed at the host level, with 46\% of all isolates collected from the commonly grown host genotype Genesis090 (classified as “resistant” during the term of collection) identified as highly aggressive. Of these, 63\% belonged to the ARH01 haplotype. In conclusion, the ARH01 haplotype represents a significant risk to the Australian chickpea industry, being not only widely adapted to the diverse agro-geographical environments of the Australian chickpea growing regions, but also containing a disproportionately large number of aggressive isolates, indicating fitness to survive and replicate on the best resistance sources in the Australian germplasm.},

  abstract = {Traditional culture methods for identifying the plant fungal pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary and Botrytis cinerea Pers.:Fr. are slow and laborious. The goal of this study was to develop a multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to detect and quantify DNA from S.~sclerotiorum and B.~cinerea. A primer set (SsIGS\_5) for S.~sclerotiorum was designed that targeted the intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of the ribosomal DNA. Addition of a probe to the assay increased its specificity: when the primer/probe set was tested against 21 fungal species (35 strains), amplification was detected from all S.~sclerotiorum strains and no other species. For qPCR, the SsIGS\_5 primer and probe set exhibited a linear range from 7·0~ng to 0·07~pg target DNA (R2~=~0·99). SsIGS\_5 was then multiplexed with a previously published primer/probe set for B.~cinerea to develop a high-throughput method for the detection and quantification of DNA from both pathogens. When multiplexed, the sensitivity and specificity of both assays were not different from individual qPCR reactions. The multiplex assay is currently being used to detect and quantify S.~sclerotiorum and B.~cinerea DNA from aerosol samples collected in commercial seed alfalfa fields.

Significance and Impact of the Study

A primer and probe set for the quantification of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum DNA in a PCR assay was developed. The probe-based nature of this assay signifies an improvement over previous assays for this species by allowing multiplex reactions while maintaining high sensitivity. The primer/probe set was used in a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the quantification of S.~sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea DNA, enabling rapid analysis of environmental samples. In crops susceptible to both pathogens, this multiplex assay can be used to quickly quantify the presence of each pathogen.},

  url = {https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:399450},
  abstract = {New diagnostic technologies for the detection of plant pathogens with high multiplexing ability and point-of-care (POC) capability are an essential tool in the fight to reduce the large agricultural production losses caused by plant diseases. The main desirable characteristics for such diagnostic assays are high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, quickness, cost efficiency and high-throughput multiplex detection capability. The aim of this project is to develop new methods combining nucleic acid amplification, multiplexing and point-of-care application for the detection of plant pathogens.

Isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) which operates at low constant temperature are especially suited for POC applications. However, the development of a rapid and simplified detection method for the isothermal amplification products in resource-poor settings is still challenging. A new method to visualize the success of the amplification step, and therefore the presence of pathogen DNA in a sample, was developed based on bridging flocculation. This method requires minimal equipment and can be assessed by the naked eye allowing its use in POC settings. The method was initially applied to the rapid and sensitive detection of several important plant pathogens and subsequently extended to animal and human pathogens to demonstrate the wide applications of the approach. A nanoparticle based electrochemical biosensor was also developed for rapid and sensitive detection of amplified plant pathogen DNA on screen-printed carbon electrodes. Gold nanoparticles were employed as a probe for electrochemical assessment by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). This method was 10,000 times more sensitive than conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/gel electrophoresis and could readily identify P. syringae infected plant samples even before the disease symptoms were visible.

To allow multiplex detection of plant pathogen, a novel method that can screen for thousands of plant pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity using molecular inversion probes (MIPs) was been developed. As proof of concept, a MIP targeting a unique DNA sequence present in the F.oxysporum f.sp. conglutinans (Foc) genome was designed. The specificity, sensitivity and detection limit of the assay were assessed and used to detect the presence of pathogen in infected Arabidopsis thaliana samples. This methodology successfully detected as little as 2.5 ng of pathogen DNA and it was highly specific, being able to accurately differentiate Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. conglutinans from other fungal pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea and even pathogens of the same species such as Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici. Finally, a diagnostic platform for POC plant pathogen detection using a combination of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and RPA was developed for rapid multiplex detection. The RPA-SERS method was faster, more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction and could detect as little as 2 copies of B. cinerea DNA. Furthermore, multiplex detection of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. conglutinans, f.sp. lycopersici and Botrytis cinerea was demonstrated in vivo in Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato. The assay was subsequently simplified into a single tube assay and tested outside of a laboratory setting to detect pathogens in tomato plants.},

In this article, we described a real-time PCR assay for the determination and quantification of A. rabiei infection in chickpea tissues and accurate monitoring of disease progression in plant materials inoculated with different inoculation methods. The primer pairs HEF1/HEF2 were designed to anneal to conserved regions of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF) gene for specific amplification of 82-bp fragment of A. rabiei based on SYBR Green I technology. The detection limit of assay was determined as 0.1 pg DNA. PCR specificity was confirmed by testing against uninfected chickpea tissues and another fungal species associated with chickpea. The chickpea plants were inoculated by the methods of whole-plant and detached leaflet inoculation. Disease progression in resistant and susceptible cultivars was evaluated at certain time intervals after pathogen inoculation by real-time PCR. The results revealed a good correlation between visual assessments of disease reaction and pathogen quantification in infected chickpea tissues. The target DNA sequence was also amplified from the samples of DNA extracts from artificially infested seed. This technique could provide a useful approach for efficient selection of resistant breeding material in an early stage of infection as an alternative to the visual disease assessment and will be also used for the determination and quantification of A. rabiei infection.},

  abstract = {Background
Long-read sequencing technologies were launched a few years ago, and in contrast with short-read sequencing technologies, they offered a promise of solving assembly problems for large and complex genomes. Moreover by providing long-range information, it could also solve haplotype phasing. However, existing long-read technologies still have several limitations that complicate their use for most research laboratories, as well as in large and/or complex genome projects. In 2014, Oxford Nanopore released the MinION® device, a small and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencer, which offers the possibility of sequencing long DNA fragments.

Results
The assembly of long reads generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION® instrument is challenging as existing assemblers were not implemented to deal with long reads exhibiting close to 30\% of errors. Here, we presented a hybrid approach developed to take advantage of data generated using MinION® device. We sequenced a well-known bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and applied our method to obtain a highly contiguous (one single contig) and accurate genome assembly even in repetitive regions, in contrast to an Illumina-only assembly. Our hybrid strategy was able to generate NaS (Nanopore Synthetic-long) reads up to 60~kb that aligned entirely and with no error to the reference genome and that spanned highly conserved repetitive regions. The average accuracy of NaS reads reached 99.99\% without losing the initial size of the input MinION® reads.

Conclusions
We described NaS tool, a hybrid approach allowing the sequencing of microbial genomes using the MinION® device. Our method, based ideally on 20x and 50x of NaS and Illumina reads respectively, provides an efficient and cost-effective way of sequencing microbial or small eukaryotic genomes in a very short time even in small facilities. Moreover, we demonstrated that although the Oxford Nanopore technology is a relatively new sequencing technology, currently with a high error rate, it is already useful in the generation of high-quality genome assemblies.

Moreover nanopore sequencing allowed us to generate a chromosome-level assembly for the L. maculans reference isolate, JN3. The genome annotation was supported by integrating conserved proteins and RNA sequencing from Leptosphaeria-infected samples. The newly produced high-quality assemblies and annotations of those three Leptosphaeria genomes will allow further studies, notably focused on the tripartite interaction between L. maculans, L. biglobosa and oilseed rape.

The third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, led by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), is progressing rapidly, moving from a technology once only capable of providing data for small genome analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the MinION, the first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MinION identifies DNA bases by measuring the changes in electrical conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the release of the long read sequencer MinION has thus generated much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from SGS data, assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality can be greatly improved by using TGS long reads, since repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at locations where rapid and reliable sequencing is needed, but where resources are limited.},

  abstract = {The MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) is a paradigm shifting device allowing rapid, real time long read sequencing of nucleic acids. Yet external benchmarking of this technologies’ capabilities has not been extensively reported, nor has thorough evaluation of its utility for field-based analysis with sub-optimal sample types been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of the MinION sequencer for bacterial genomic and metagenomic applications, with specific emphasis placed on the quality, yield, and accuracy of generated sequence data. Two independent laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory (Public Health Agency of Canada), sequenced a set of microbes in replicate, using the currently available flowcells, sequencing chemistries, and software available at the time of the experiment. Overall sequencing yield and quality improved through the course of this set of experiments. Sequencing alignment accuracy was high reaching 97\% for all 2D experiments, though was slightly lower for 1D sequencing (94\%). 1D sequencing provided much longer sequences than 2D. Both sequencing chemistries performed equally well in constructing genomic assemblies. There was evidence of barcode cross-over using both the native and PCR barcoding methods. Despite the sub-optimal nature of samples sequenced in the field, sequences attributable to B. anthracis the target organism used in this scenario, could none-the-less be detected. Together, this report showcases the rapid advancement in this technology and its utility in the context of genomic sequencing of microbial isolates of importance to public health.},

The main desirable characteristics for such diagnostic assays are high specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, quickness, cost efficiency and high-throughput multiplex detection capability. This article describes and discusses various DNA-based point-of care diagnostic methods for applications in plant disease detection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most common DNA amplification technology used for detecting various plant and animal pathogens. However, subsequent to PCR based assays, several types of nucleic acid amplification technologies have been developed to achieve higher sensitivity, rapid detection as well as suitable for field applications such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, helicase-dependent amplification, rolling circle amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, and molecular inversion probe. The principle behind these technologies has been thoroughly discussed in several review papers; herein we emphasize the application of these technologies to detect plant pathogens by outlining the advantages and disadvantages of each technology in detail.},

  abstract = {Infectious plant diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, viroids, phytoplasma and nematodes. Worldwide, plant pathogen infections are among main factors limiting crop productivity and increasing economic losses. Plant pathogen detection is important as first step to manage a plant disease in greenhouses, field conditions and at the country boarders. Current immunological techniques used to detect pathogens in plant include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and direct tissue blot immunoassays (DTBIA). DNA-based techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time PCR (RT-PCR) and dot blot hybridization have also been proposed for pathogen identification and detection. However these methodologies are time-consuming and require complex instruments, being not suitable for in-situ analysis. Consequently, there is strong interest for developing new biosensing systems for early detection of plant diseases with high sensitivity and specificity at the point-of-care. In this context, we revise here the recent advancement in the development of advantageous biosensing systems for plant pathogen detection based on both antibody and DNA receptors. The use of different nanomaterials such as nanochannels and metallic nanoparticles for the development of innovative and sensitive biosensing systems for the detection of pathogens (i.e. bacteria and viruses) at the point-of-care is also shown. Plastic and paper-based platforms have been used for this purpose, offering cheap and easy-to-use really integrated sensing systems for rapid on-site detection. Beside devices developed at research and development level a brief revision of commercially available kits is also included in this review.},

  abstract = {Metagenomic experiments attempt to characterize microbial communities using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Identification of the microorganisms in a sample provides information about the genetic profile, population structure, and role of microorganisms within an environment. Until recently, most metagenomics studies focused on high-level characterization at the level of phyla, or alternatively sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA gene that is present in bacterial species. As the cost of sequencing has fallen, though, metagenomics experiments have increasingly used unbiased shotgun sequencing to capture all the organisms in a sample. This approach requires a method for estimating abundance directly from the raw read data. Here we describe a fast, accurate new method that computes the abundance at the species level using the reads collected in a metagenomics experiment. Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with KrakEN) uses the taxonomic assignments made by Kraken, a very fast read-level classifier, along with information about the genomes themselves to estimate abundance at the species level, the genus level, or above. We demonstrate that Bracken can produce accurate species- and genus-level abundance estimates even when a sample contains multiple near-identical species.},

  abstract = {Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8\%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5\% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3\%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3\%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.},
